IMAP (*Integrating Microwave Link Data For Analysis of Precipitation in Complex Terrain: Theoretical Aspects and Hydrometeorological Applications*) focuses on improving rainfall estimation from commercial microwave link (CML) data to subsequently improve modeling and forecasting flooding events.

## Project objectives

The specific scientific objectives are:
1. To mitigate errors and to improve calibration for microwave attenuation derived precipitation
estimates.
2. To investigate the potential of microwave link data as source of atmospheric humidity information.
3. To improve estimates of the spatio-temporal rainfall distribution by developing new data integration
and reconstruction methods for gauge-, radar- and microwave link data, as well as high resolution
hydrometeorological model output.
4. To set up and extend a coupled hydrometeorological model system (WRF-Hydro) that allows to
account for the complex and fast precipitation-runoff processes in mountainous terrain.

The specific strategic objectives are:
1. To enable the acquisition of microwave link data from the Palestine cell phone provider Wataniya
and combine it with the existing data from Israel to provide a better coverage of the area of Israel
and Palestine and establish a joint data base.
2. To set up and extend the direct acquisition of commercial microwave link data in Germany to
increase the number of available links.
3. To develop and setup a new flood and flash flood forecasting system at the Israeli Hydrological
Service (IHS).
4. To initiate and intensify exchange of scientific expertise and knowledge between Israel, Palestine
and Germany.
