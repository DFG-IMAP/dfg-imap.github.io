IMAP focuses on improving rainfall estimation from commercial microwave link (CML) data to subsequently improve modeling and forecasting flooding events.

IMAP [is funded by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/254695484?contrast=1&language=en) with a duration of 5 years from 2014 till 2019. It is DFG trilateral project with partners from Germany, Israel and Palestine. See the [project summary](/about/) for the list of project partners and the [team site](/team/) with the list of all researchers working on the project.
