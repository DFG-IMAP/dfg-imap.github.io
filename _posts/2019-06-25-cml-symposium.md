More than 40 participants from academia, industry, and national meteorological and hydrological services have gathered in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to hold the first [Symposium on the hydrometeorological usage of data from commercial microwave link networks ](https://indico.scc.kit.edu/e/hymet_cml_symposium_2019).

The main objectives of the symposium have been to:
    1.    Present and discuss the newest research results
    2.    Foster exchange between the involved research groups
    3.    Initiate discussion with stakeholder, e.g. hydrological services and cellular operators
    4.    Identify pathways towards operational usage

On Day1 the research groups involved in hydrometeorological usage of data from CML networks gave an overview of the current state of the art. In addition stakeholders were be able to present their view on the usage of CML data and on tackling the hydrometeorological challenge of rainfall observation in general. Day1 presented the unique opportunity for researchers and stakeholder to discuss requirements and pathways for future hydrometeorological CML applications.

On Day2 and Day3 researchers presented and discussed specific topics of the hydrometeorological usage of data from CML networks, e.g. processing methods, spatial reconstruction, data fusion, data formats, benchmark data sets, standard performance metrics, naming conventions, etc.. Discussion rounds then focused on potential future collaborations and joint proposals.

Day4 was used to conclude the tasks from Day2 and Day3 and to wrap-up.
