As every year, Prof. Hagit Messer-Yaron and Prof. Pinhas Alpert have invited their Israeli partners from academia, governmental institutions and industry to present and discuss the latest research at the "CELLular ENvironment MONitoring" (CELLENMON) workshop. This year CELLENMON was held in conjunction with an IMAP project meeting, so that the German IMAP partners also could participate. 

This was a great opportunity for all IMAP researchers to present and discuss their work with the participants, e.g. from Israeli mobile network operators and from the Israeli Meteorological Service.

The two day before the CELLENMON workshop were used to move forward the collaborating work within the project. In addition the German IMAP team traveled to Nablus to meet with the Palestinian project partners at An-Najah National University, because they were not able to travel to Tel Aviv.
