As every year, Prof. Hagit Messer-Yaron and Prof. Pinhas Alpert have invited their Israeli partners from academia, governmental institutions and industry to present and discuss the latest research at the "CELLular ENvironment MONitoring" (CELLENMON) workshop. This year CELLENMON was held in conjunction with an IMAP project meeting, so that the German IMAP partners also could participate.
