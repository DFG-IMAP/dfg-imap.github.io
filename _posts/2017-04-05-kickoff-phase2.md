After the successful renewal proposal, IMAP was allowed to continue with its Phase 2. The kick-off meeting with all project partners was held at [KIT Campus Alpin](https://www.imk-ifu.kit.edu/) in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

After the status reports of the individual WPs, the schedule and the responsibilities for IMAP Phase 2 have been discussed in detail. A large part of the time was also spent on jointly working on CML data exchange and hydrological modeling using WRF-Hydro Offline, where CML rainfall fields were applied as forcing.
