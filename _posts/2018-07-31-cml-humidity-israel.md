Building on their initial work [(David et al., 2009)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/9/2413/2009/) IMAP researchers from Tel Aviv University have, for the first time, accomplished to derive daily mapping of surface moisture from CML data [(Alpert and Rubin, 2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078661).

Since atmospheric humidity plays in important role in the rainfall generation process, it is a cardinal part in weather prediction. CML attenuation data can be used to derive humidity estimates, because atmospheric humidity leads to attenuation, in particular for CML frequencies close to 23 GHz. Here, for the first time CML-derived humidity maps were and compared to output from a forecast model from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts. The CML humidity maps showed better correlations with weather stations, which represent the real humidity in the air. Good results were obtained also for other statistical skills, indicating the quality and the accuracy of the cellular measurements.

The humidity derived from CML attenuation data was found to be more accurate as compared to the forecast models. Consequently, the new humidity‐measuring method has to potential to improve weather prediction, in particular for heavy rainfall.
