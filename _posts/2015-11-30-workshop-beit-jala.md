IMAP is a trilateral project with German, Israeli and Palestinian partners. Due to the political situation it was, however, not straightforward to find a venue to which all participants could travel. For our workshop in 2015 we identified the Everest Hotel in Beit Jala as a possible location, because it is in a part of the [Area C of the West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C_(West_Bank)) which is accessible to both, Israelis and Palestinians.

This allowed us to have a joint project meeting with the full IMAP team in the region. For all IMAP researchers it was for sure a special experience to work and meet in this small zone between borders which are not easily traversable for parts of the team.

Nevertheless, we had to focus on the science, in particular the upcoming milestones of IMAP phase 1 and the renewal proposal wich was scheduled for early 2016. Besides presenting and discussing the state of the individual work packages a large portion of time was spent on setting up CML data exchange and on developing a concept for integrating CML data in the hydrological model WRF-Hydro Offline.
